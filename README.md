  Reddit Clone built with React & Typescript
</p>

## Short Description
A Reddit Clone built with TypeScript, React and SCSS. Additional to the famous infinite scrolling home page I also implemented subreddits, individual post pages, comments and nested comments, post submission, profile pages and various dropdown menu's, including the search bar and notifications. Users can join and leave subreddits, add/remove them to/from their favorites, can like posts and comments or create some on their own. A detailed feature list can be found at the end of this document.

## Showcase
You can see images of the project in user interaction below. The user starts on the home page, signs up with a new account, selects a subreddit and much more. Detailed descriptions can be found right beneath the images. These images only show the most elementary user interactions. <br /> <br />

## Performance
I let [Google Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=de) run over my application to check for it's **performance, accessibility, use of best practices and SEO optimization**. You can view the results right below this paragraph.

## Motivation
My motivations in building this project were showcasing what I learned so far and to have somewhat of a "sandbox" to experiment and build within. I was able to learn new libraries and I had to be creative with ways to increase my application's performance. I also believed that building a project with a much bigger codebase than my preceding ones and learning how to organize such a codebase could set me off better for work in a business environment - and it did.

## Features
- Expressive, responsive and clear UI/UX
- Extensive unit and integration tests to ensure intentional behaviour
- Search any game you want
- Filters to sort after genres and ratings
- Like & Wishlist feature to track your personal wishlist
- Smooth Animations with Framer Motion
- Quick Navigation to view all parts of the project without having to click through it

## Technologies Used
- React
- React Router Dom
- Framer Motion
- Jest
- CSS
- Git
- CDN 

## What I learned:
- Using motion libraries (e.g. Framer Motion) to achieve much smoother user experiences while maintaining clean code
- Working with a CDN (Cloud Delivery Network) to improve performance by accelerating bundle delivery
- organizing and connect a project with React Router Dom
