  Reddit Clone built with React & Typescript
</p>

## Short Description üìã
A Reddit Clone built with TypeScript, React and SCSS. Additional to the famous infinite scrolling home page I also implemented subreddits, individual post pages, comments and nested comments, post submission, profile pages and various dropdown menu's, including the search bar and notifications. Users can join and leave subreddits, add/remove them to/from their favorites, can like posts and comments or create some on their own. A detailed feature list can be found at the end of this document.

## Demo üî¥
‚öõÔ∏è [Live Demo](https://gianlucajahn.github.io/typescript-reddit-clone) available. Click "Live Demo" to open it.

## Showcase üé¨
You can see images of the project in user interaction below. The user starts on the home page, signs up with a new account, selects a subreddit and much more. Detailed descriptions can be found right beneath the images. These images only showcase the most elementary user interactions. <br /> <br />

## Performance ‚è±
I let [Google Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=de) run over my application to check for it's **performance, accessibility, use of best practices and SEO optimization**. You can view the results right below this paragraph.

## Technologies Used üíª
- TypeScript
- React
- React Router Dom
- SCSS
- Git

## What I learned üìö
- Working with a strongly typed language like TypeScript and learning to type to minimize bugs/errors
- Organizing a bigger codebase descriptively and maintaining efficiency of the end product
- Manipulating objects in state and working with optional parameters and props in TypeScript

## Motivation
My motivations in building this project was moving on with what I learned about JavaScript and React, jumping into a newer technology - TypeScript, in this case - and working on a big codebase on my own. This project currently consists of just a bit more than 24,000 lines of code, so while still not being a corporate size project, I learned how to structure sizeable codebases effectively. My next endeavour will be working with backends, possibly utilizing Next.js in the process.
