A sorta fish out of water story about something or someone being accepted by those that are seen as dangerous or outcasts from society but aren really. If you like that sorta idea what would be your idea for a similar movie or show to Chappie? Let’s discuss about it.",

It’s hard as a history buff for sure because this film is way off as far as accuracy goes and the fact that Mel Gibson isn’t the greatest person (to put it mildly) but the man has a talent for cinema. Despite me being incredibly far removed from any relation to ancient tribal people, the characters in this story are super relatable. Their sense of humor, the family bonds, the fear… this film really makes you think that you could have been anyone of them. If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend you do. It’s an incredible thriller and criminally underrated.",

Director Quentin Tarantino said, I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year. Martin Scorsese, writing about the film, called it a vision, adding, Many pictures today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of whats known as civilization. I admire Apocalypto for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking. Actor Edward James Olmos said, I was totally caught off guard. Its arguably the best movie Ive seen in years. I was blown away. In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films."
