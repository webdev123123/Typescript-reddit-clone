A sorta fish out of water story about something or someone being accepted by those that are seen as dangerous or outcasts from society but aren really. If you like that sorta idea what would be your idea for a similar movie or show to Chappie? Let’s discuss about it.",

It’s hard as a history buff for sure because this film is way off as far as accuracy goes and the fact that Mel Gibson isn’t the greatest person (to put it mildly) but the man has a talent for cinema. Despite me being incredibly far removed from any relation to ancient tribal people, the characters in this story are super relatable. Their sense of humor, the family bonds, the fear… this film really makes you think that you could have been anyone of them. If you haven’t seen it, I highly recommend you do. It’s an incredible thriller and criminally underrated.",

Director Quentin Tarantino said, I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year. Martin Scorsese, writing about the film, called it a vision, adding, Many pictures today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of whats known as civilization. I admire Apocalypto for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking. Actor Edward James Olmos said, I was totally caught off guard. Its arguably the best movie Ive seen in years. I was blown away. In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films."

I huff some more paint to pass the time, and oh boy does it pass. The client is ready to go by 7:30. Everybody keeps saying it's laggy, but I don't notice any difference from usual. Maybe I'm just too intelligent, or maybe the paint is finally doing its job. I queue up solo - normal blind pick of course. The queue pops, and Clippy asks me if I want help selecting my champion. Not now not ever, I think boastfully at the cartoon paper clip. I lock in Dr. Munro. My teammates pick Shaco and all the others pick hot anime girls. I take one last good long huff to get ready for the game, and in we go. The first thing I notice is that their team doesn't have a dt Munford. Free win then. I go top lane. I always go top lane. They have a Aatrod. Pathetic. I hit the minions. I miss some crepes bc I have 450 ping. Aatrox tries ro hit me but I heal up bc I'm drMindoro.",

The only thing I could see happening if it were implemented in some way would be players wishing on the weapon banner instead of event characters as unless they want the new character, they might be more inclined to get the starglitter from weapons than from losing to a character.
